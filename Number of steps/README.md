You are given two arrays `a1, a2,..., an` and `b1, b2,...,bn`. In each step, you can set `ai = ai - bi` if `ai>=bi` Determine the minimum number of steps that are required to make all a's equal.

### Input Format

  - First line: `n`
  - Second line: `a1, a2,..., an`
  - Third line: `b1, b2,...,bn`

### Output Format
Print the minimum number of steps that are required to make all 
's equal. If it is not possible, then print **-1.**

### Constraints
`1 <= n`, `a1, b1 <= 5000`

### Sample Input
2\
5 6\
4 3

### Sample Output
-1
